# expo-nextjs-webpack-5

An experiment to get the @expo/next-adapter working with the latest NextJS 10.2 features

If using yarn

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

If using npm

```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm start
```

## Issues

> NPM install fails due to peer dependencies

Use `--legacy-peer-deps` when installing

> Babel class properties errors when building \_document.tsx

Resolved by patching @expo/next-adapter to add the missing babel transform

> `TypeError: Cannot read property 'version' of undefined`

Resolved by locking "html-webpack-plugin" to "5.3.0"

> NextJS pages do not compile

Resolved by patching ignoreExternalModules to Webpack5 syntax

> NextJS react transform conflicts with Expo react trasform

Resolved by patching babel-preset-expo to enable useTransformReactJsxExperimental

> PostCSS Errors when building in production

`optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin` is deprecated for Webpack5. Need to patch @expo/webpack-config to use `css-minimizer-webpack-plugin`

> React-native-web cannot use import outside of module

Add `react-native-web` to Next transpile modules

NOTE: This is a work around and not always needed. This is a temp fix until the underlying problem is understood
